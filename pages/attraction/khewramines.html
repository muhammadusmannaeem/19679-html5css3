                                    The Khewra Salt Mine (or Mayo Salt Mine) is in Khewra, north of Pind Dadan Khan, an
                                    administrative subdivision of Jhelum District, Punjab Region, Pakistan. The mine is
                                    in the Salt Range, Potohar plateau, which rises from the Indo-Gangetic Plain, and is
                                    the second largest in the world.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The mine is famous for its production of pink Khewra salt, often marketed as
                                    Himalayan salt, and is a major tourist attraction, drawing up to 250,000 visitors a
                                    year. Its history dates back to its discovery by Alexander's troops in 320 BC,
                                    but it started trading in the Mughal era. The main tunnel at ground level was
                                    developed by Dr. H. Warth, a mining engineer, in 1872 during British rule. After
                                    independence, the BMR took possession until 1956 and then PIDC owned the mines till
                                    1965. After India-Pakistan war in 1965, the WPIDC took over the administration of
                                    salt mines and in 1974, the Pakistan Mineral Development Corporation took over the
                                    mine, which still remains the largest source of salt in the country, producing more
                                    than 350,000 tons per annum of about 99% pure halite. Estimates of the
                                    reserves of salt in the mine vary from 82 million tons to 600 million tons.

                                    The Khewra Salt Mine is also known as Mayo Salt Mine, in honour of Lord Mayo, who
                                    visited it as Viceroy of India. The salt reserves at Khewra were discovered when
                                    Alexander the Great crossed the Jhelum and Mianwali region during his Indian
                                    campaign. The mine was discovered, however, not by Alexander, nor by his allies, but
                                    by his army's horses, when they were found licking the stones. Ailing horses of
                                    his army also recovered after licking the rock salt stones. During the Mughal
                                    era the salt was traded in various markets, as far away as Central Asia. On the
                                    downfall of the Mughal empire, the mine was taken over by Sikhs. Hari Singh Nalwa,
                                    the Sikh Commander-in-Chief, shared the management of the Salt Range with Gulab
                                    Singh, the Raja of Jammu. The former controlled the Warcha mine, while the latter
                                    held Khewra. The salt quarried during Sikh rule was both eaten and used as a source
                                    of revenue.

                                        In 1872, some time after they had taken over the Sikhs' territory, the British
                                        developed the mine further. They found the mining to have been inefficient,
                                        with irregular and narrow tunnels and entrances that made the movement of
                                        labourers difficult and dangerous. The supply of water inside the mine was poor,
                                        and there was no storage facility for the mined salt. The only road to the mine
                                        was over difficult, rocky terrain. To address these problems the government
                                        levelled the road, built warehouses, provided a water supply, improved the
                                        entrances and tunnels, and introduced a better mechanism for excavation of salt.
                                        Penalties were introduced to control salt smuggling.

                                    Khewra Salt Mine is in Pind Dadan Khan Tehsil of Jhelum District. About 160 km (100
                                    miles) from Islamabad and Lahore, it is accessed via the M-2 motorway, about 30
                                    kilometres (20 miles) off the Lilla interchange while going towards Pind Dadan Khan
                                    on the Lilla road. The mine is in mountains that are part of a salt range, a
                                    mineral-rich mountain system extending about 200 km from the Jhelum river south of
                                    Pothohar Plateau to where the Jhelum river joins the Indus river. Khewra
                                    mine is about 288 meters (945 feet) above sea level and about 730 meters (2400
                                    feet) into the mountain from the mine entrance. The underground mine covers an area
                                    of 110 km2 (43 sq. miles).

                                    year, earning it considerable revenue. Visitors are taken into the mine on
                                    the Khewra Salt Mines Railway. There are numerous pools of salty water inside.
                                    The Badshahi Masjid was built in the mining tunnels with multi-coloured salt
                                    bricks about fifty years ago. Other artistic carvings in the mine include
                                    a replica of Minar-e-Pakistan, a statue of Allama Iqbal, an accumulation of crystals
                                    that form the name of Muhammad in Urdu script, a model of the Great Wall of China
                                    and another of the Mall Road of Murree. In 2003 two phases of development of
                                    tourist facilities and attractions were carried out, at a total cost of 9 million
                                    rupees. A clinical ward with 20 beds was established in 2007, costing 10 million

                                    therapy. The "Visit Pakistan Year 2007" event included a train safari visit of
                                    Khewra Salt Mine. In February 2011 Pakistan Railways started operating special
