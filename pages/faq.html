                                    Jhelum is a city on the east bank of the Jhelum River, which is located in the
                                    district of Jhelum in the north of Punjab province,
                                    Pakistan. It is the 44th largest city of Pakistan by population. Jhelum is known for
                                    providing many soldiers to the British Army before independence, and later to the
                                    Pakistan armed forces due to which it is also known as City of Soldiers or Land of
                                    Martyrs and Warriors.

                                        Many writers have different opinions about the name of Jhelum. One suggestion is
                                        that in ancient days Jhelumabad was known as Jalham. The word Jhelum is
                                        reportedly derived from the words Jal (pure water) and Ham (snow). The name thus
                                        refers to
                                        the waters of a river (flowing besides the city) which have their origins in the
                                        snow-capped Himalayas.
                                        Jehlum is also a river in Pakistan and Kashmir, rising in W central Kashmir and
                                        flowing northwest through the Vale of Kashmir, then southwest into NW Punjab to
                                        join the Chenab River: important for irrigation, having the Mangla Dam

                                    dry in winter. The maximum recorded temperature in the pre-monsoon season of April
                                    to June is 49.2 °C (120.6 °F), whereas in winter the minimum temperature recorded is
                                    -0.6 °C (30.9 °F). Average annual rainfall is about 850 millimetres (33 in) which is
                                    much below the required quantity given the extremely high evaporation levels.
