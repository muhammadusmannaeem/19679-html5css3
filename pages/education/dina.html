                                    Contact the schools you are interested in and make an appointment for a visit. If
                                    possible, tour the schools during regular school hours and visit a few classes.
                                    Avoid visiting schools during the first or last week of a term in order to get a
                                    realistic sense of how the school operates.
                                    A good way to have your questions answered is to schedule an appointment with the
                                    school principal. If possible, attend an open house, parent-teacher meeting, or
                                    other school function that would also provide valuable information about the
                                    attitudes of staff, students, and parents.

                                        Along with the schools' curricula and philosophy, you will want to know about
                                        school policies and services. Parents may also wish to consider the after-school
                                        programs a school offers, for example, sports, clubs, tutoring, or academic
                                        enrichment. Some schools have after-school activities funded by the U.S.
                                        Department of Education's 21st Century Community Learning Centers program. These
                                        centers provide educational activities outside of the regular school
                                        hours'before and after school or during summer vacation' that complement what is
                                        taught in school. You may also want to ask if the school has supplemental
                                        educational services, including free tutoring, that are offered outside of the
                                        regular school hours under No Child Left Behind.

                                    Admissions processes can vary. Your child may need to be tested or interviewed, and
                                    you may need to provide a school transcript, recommendations, or other information.
                                    It would be helpful to learn about admissions criteria for the schools. You will
                                    want to double check to be sure you have accurate information on when and how to

                                        wisely for these essential conversations. Be an active listener. Avoid jumping
                                        in as she expresses her thoughts. Choose a relaxed, informal setting for this
                                        important conversation. Chatting with your daughter while out shopping or
                                        driving around town will be a much less confrontational experience for her than
                                        having a formal discussion.

                                    Your child will benefit tremendously from your active concern and involvement with
                                    his or her education. By collecting information, talking to other parents, visiting
                                    schools, and exercising your right to choose, you can now take the lead in making
                                    sure your son or daughter gets the best possible education. However, this is only
                                    the beginning. By staying involved in your child's education, encouraging your child
                                    to work hard, and providing additional opportunities to learn at home and in the
                                    community, you can help your child go further still. Remember it is your right, as
                                    well as your responsibility, to seek the very best education for your son or
                                    daughter.

                                        Studying robotics is very popular in many schools. Given the importance of this
                                        technology in manufacturing, it is a subject well worth studying in as much
                                        depth as you possibly can before you get to college. Take a look at the program
                                        which our College offers.
                                        Engineering at our College is a progressive, multi-year program that allows
                                        students to explore mechanical, electro-mechanical, and control systems and
                                        processes in a laboratory setting.
                                        Such programs weren't even on the radar ten years ago in most schools. However,
                                        trigonometry and calculus were. It is another example of how boarding schools
                                        adapt to changing circumstances by preparing their students for the world in
                                        which they will live as adults.
