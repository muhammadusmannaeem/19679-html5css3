                                        Riding programs are something many parents insist that their children have. Most
                                        programs feature English-style riding programs and facilities but there are a
                                        few schools that also offer Western-style riding. Look at the equestrian program
                                        which The Kent School offers. It's been around for decades and is nationally
                                        recognized.
                                        And here, it's not just about the riding. The program centers around
                                        creating a well-rounded rider. The student learns all areas of horse management
                                        including stable management, veterinary care and conditioning needs. We strive
                                        to produce an all-around horseperson who is knowledgeable, caring, competent and
                                        exemplifies good horsemanship and sportsmanship.

                                    well-maintained and newly-renovated facility. Brand new large locker rooms, training
                                    rooms, and physical therapy areas serve the teams well. There is a video room for
                                    teams and coaches to use to evaluate and improve their performance. A
                                    state-of-the-art weight and fitness center is used to maintain and gain strength and
                                    flexibility during the season as well as during the off-season. The student body
                                    embraces the sport of ice hockey and all games are well-attended events that help to
                                    make the atmosphere at Jennings-Fairchild rink special.

                                    What to consider when choosing a college or university
                                    Factors to Consider When Choosing a College or University
                                    by Becton Loveless.
                                    You have probably heard it over and over again: choosing a college is one of the
                                    most important decisions you will make in your life. And it's true. Where you attend
                                    college will have a lasting impact on your personal and professional life.
                                    But the truth is, many students select a college based on emotion or a very limited
                                    set of criteria-sometimes just a gut feeling. While this won't preclude you from
                                    academic success, such an important decision should probably undergo a higher level
                                    of scrutiny.
                                    If you're shopping around for colleges, you're going to want to consider a broad
                                    range of factors, such as location, size, cost, academic quality, campus safety,
                                    choice of majors, as well as other factors that are important to you personally.

                                        The variety of extracurricular activities which most boarding schools offer is
                                        simply mind-boggling. Most boarding schools will offer whatever activity your
                                        child might be interested in. One of the unique things about extracurricular
                                        activities in private schools is that they are led and supervised by your
                                        child's teachers. That means that students get to see their teachers in action
                                        outside of the classroom. It's all part of the balanced approach to education in
                                        which private schools believe. Since this is an important consideration in
                                        choosing the right school for your child, take time to review the
                                        extracurricular activity programs offered. I lost count of the number of clubs
                                        offered at St. Mary's School in Raleigh, North Carolina. The school offers its
                                        students an amazing variety of club activities. This is typical of the sort of
                                        extracurricular programs that you will find in boarding schools.

                                    Admissions processes can vary. Your child may need to be tested or interviewed, and
                                    you may need to provide a school transcript, recommendations, or other information.
                                    It would be helpful to learn about admissions criteria for the schools. You will
                                    want to double check to be sure you have accurate information on when and how to
                                    apply.

                                    Colleges look for students who took the most challenging courses available to them
                                    who performed well in each class. Some high schools don't offer many college prep
                                    classes. If that is the case for your high school, admissions officers will take
                                    this into account. They may also look favorably upon students who seek challenge
                                    outside of school; for example, by taking community college courses or AP courses
                                    online.

                                        You may not know what career you want to pursue after graduation, but you
                                        certainly know what your interests are and what you're good at. Thinking about
                                        this will help you figure out if you're leaning towards liberal arts or a
                                        technical field.
                                        Self-reflection will also help you get a grasp on other factors. Do you want to
                                        attend a large or small school? Far away or close to home? Expensive or
                                        affordable? As you ask yourself these questions, you will begin to have a better
                                        understanding of your own priorities.
                                        It may even be possible that you're not quite ready for college yet. You may
                                        want to take a year off, but make sure that you spend it wisely. Other countries
                                        have a tradition of students taking a year after high school to travel, work or
                                        volunteer. This is not a tradition in the United States, so you want to make
                                        sure you do something productive with your time. When you finally do apply for
                                        colleges, they will want to know what you did with your free time during the
                                        prime of your life.

                                    Before you spend any time investigating a college, first make sure it is accredited.
                                    This means that an officially licensed organization has vetted the school and
                                    reviewed its curriculum to verify that it meets basic academic standards for higher
                                    education.
                                    Most colleges will readily provide this information on their website-usually on the
                                    About or Admissions pages. If you're having trouble finding it, just call or email
                                    the admissions department.

                                        Geographic location can have a big impact on your overall college experience.
                                        Even if you like the school, if you hate where it's located the next four years
                                        could be tough. If you're looking at schools in a particular city, make sure you
                                        actually like it there. If you haven't visited in a while, you should probably
                                        schedule a trip.
                                        Also consider crime and safety, not just for the city but the campus itself.
                                        Almost every major school will provide crime statistics for campus, and many
                                        will include surrounding areas. You might think of college as a safe and fun
                                        place, and it is. But crime happens, and crime rates vary widely from school to
                                        school.Perhaps most importantly, large institutions usually provide more
                                        academic options, including hundreds of different majors and concentrations.
                                        This can be especially attractive if you haven't settled on a major or are
                                        looking to pursue an interdisciplinary major.
                                    </p>

                                    Small colleges have plenty to offer that larger institutions cannot. Many
                                    colleges stay small so they can specialize in liberal arts education or even a
                                    certain discipline within liberal arts. The campus and the class sizes will be
                                    smaller, and the overall college experience is usually much more intimate.
