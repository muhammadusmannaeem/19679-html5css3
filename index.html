                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            Jhelum is a city on the east bank of the Jhelum
                            River, which is located in the district of Jhelum in the north of Punjab province,
                            Pakistan. It is the 44th largest city of Pakistan by population. Jhelum is known for
                            providing many soldiers to the British Army before independence, and later to the
                            Pakistan armed forces due to which it is also known as City of Soldiers or Land of
                            Martyrs and Warriors.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Jhelum is a few miles upstream from the site of the ancient Battle of the Hydaspes
                            between the armies of Alexander and King Porus. Possibly Jhelum City was the capital of
                            Porus' Kingdom, Paurava. A city called Bucephala was founded nearby to commemorate the
                            death of Alexander's horse, Bucephalus. Other notable sites nearby include the
                            16th-century Rohtas Fort, the Tilla Jogian complex of ancient temples, and the
                            16th-century Grand Trunk Road which passes through the city. According to the 2017
                            census of Pakistan, the population of Jhelum was 190,425. The name of the city is
                            derived from the words Jal (pure water) and Ham (snow), as the water that flows through
                            the river originates in the Himalayas. There are a number of industries in and around
                            Jhelum city, including a tobacco factory, wood, marble, glass and flour mills.

                                Jhelum has a monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate
                                classification Cwa) and is extremely hot and humid in summer, and cold and generally
                                dry in winter. The maximum recorded temperature in the pre-monsoon season of April
                                to June is 49.2 °C (120.6 °F), whereas in winter the minimum temperature recorded is
                                -0.6 °C (30.9 °F). Average annual rainfall is about 850 millimetres (33 in) which is
                                much below the required quantity given the extremely high evaporation levels.
                                Nevertheless, in the rainy season water torrents flow from the north to the Jhelum
                                River very rapidly and cause damage to the crops, bridges, roads. This is
                                responsible for the soil erosion in the district.
